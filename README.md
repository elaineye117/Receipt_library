# SI507_final_receipt

During this unprecedented time, everyone in the state is asked for staying at home and reducing the time of going out. After you have been working and study for a long day, it is time for you to treat yourself a marvelous meal. But based on the ingredients you have, what dish could you make?
The project I want to work on is about creating an interactive product that you could type in one or multiple ingredients that you have, and the software will be able to return to you with a list of receipts, and then you could look into different receipts for cooking instruction.
This project involves working with API, web scripting

Data Source:
http://www.recipepuppy.com/
API: http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/ Data source challenge score is: 11
* Web API you haven’t used before that requires no authorizatio
* Crawling [and scraping] multiple pages in a site you haven’t used before

First attempt of using the api is sucessful. However, the returned href from the json file need some string processing to replace ‘/’ with empty thing. The hard point of this project is because returned htmls are from different websites, scraping them is a huge amount of work.
Processing and presentation:
The presentation could be the website I obtained from the API call.
