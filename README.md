# SI507_final_receipt


The project introduction video: https://youtu.be/9dabtg6N2Pg
During this unprecedented time, everyone in the state is asked for staying at home and reducing the time of going out. After you have been working and study for a long day, it is time for you to treat yourself a marvelous meal. But based on the ingredients you have, what dish could you make?
The project I want to work on is about creating an interactive product that you could type in one or multiple ingredients that you have, and the software will be able to return to you with a list of receipts, and then you could look into different receipts for cooking instruction.
Moreover, user could add their favorite recipe into their recipe database and havve access to the dababases as well as some graphs with interesting infomation of their taste.  

This project involves working with web scripting, caching, database and HTML design.
